# ðŸš€ Productivity Tracker Chrome Extension (MERN Stack Project)

This is Task 4 for the CODTECH MERN Stack Internship. The project involves developing a **Chrome Extension for Productivity Management** that helps users monitor their website usage, block distracting websites, and view daily productivity reports.

The backend is built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js (optional for admin dashboard), and Node.js), and the frontend consists of a Chrome Extension that integrates with it via REST APIs.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

To build a productivity tracking tool that runs as a Chrome Extension and communicates with a backend server to:

- Track the amount of time a user spends on different websites.
- Block distracting or blacklisted websites (user-defined).
- Generate daily productivity reports.
- Store data persistently using MongoDB.
- Sync preferences and logs across devices (via backend support).

---

## ðŸ§© Technologies Used

- **Frontend (Extension)**: HTML, JavaScript, Chrome APIs
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Environment Management**: dotenv
- **Tools**: VS Code, Postman, MongoDB Compass (optional)

cd backend
npm install

Create a .env file in /backend:

PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/productivity

Start MongoDB locally:

mongod

Then run:

node index.js

Server will run at http://localhost:5000.

  "time": 300
}

-GET /api/report

## Permissions (Chrome Extension)

manifest file includes:

"permissions": [
  "tabs",
  "webNavigation",
  "storage"
],
"host_permissions": [
  "<all_urls>"
]

This allows it to read active tabs and monitor user navigation.
